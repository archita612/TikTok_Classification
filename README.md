<h1>TikTok Classification Capstone Project</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This project aims to develop a classification model to predict the verification status of TikTok videos based on various features such as video metadata and textual content. The goal is to build an accurate model that can help classify TikTok videos as "verified" or "not verified" for content moderation and user trust purposes.</p>

<h2>Project Structure</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Data Preparation:</strong> The dataset is preprocessed by encoding categorical variables, removing irrelevant features, and splitting into training, testing, and validation sets.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Model Building:</strong> Several classification models are trained, including tree-based ensembles, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and Random Forest. Hyperparameter tuning is performed using grid search to optimize model performance.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Model Evaluation:</strong> Each model is evaluated using various performance metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score. Confusion matrices are generated to visualize model performance.</li>
  
  <li><strong>GitHub Repository:</strong> The project code, including data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation scripts, is available in this GitHub repository.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>The best-performing model achieves high accuracy and recall in classifying TikTok videos. The confusion matrix provides insights into the model's performance in predicting "verified" and "not verified" videos.</p>
